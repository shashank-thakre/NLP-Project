What do you think the story is with these photos?\\nAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .\\n\"The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.\\nPeople share photos of Illinois' abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that we've just ignored and left behind. I've lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you don't share (or ask) for addresses.\\nOver the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. I'd like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, you'd think the owner would say, \"damn, there's a tree growing through my 442, I've got to move her.\" But that clearly didn't happen. And, why is it still there? It's not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File) Thursday, March 5, 2020 1:09 PM EST By The Associated Press, AP\\nNEW YORK (AP) — Wendell Goler, a longtime White House correspondent for Fox News Channel who reported on government since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, has died at age 70.\\nHe died this week of apparent kidney failure, said a former Fox colleague, Brit Hume.\\nGoler was a Fox News original, joining the network at its inception in 1996 and working his way up to senior White House foreign affairs correspondent.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

AP PhotoCharles Dharapak, File Thursday, March 5, 2020 1:09 PM EST By The Associated Press, APNEW YORK AP  Wendell Goler, a longtime White House correspondent for Fox News Channel who reported on government since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, has died at age 70.He died this week of apparent kidney failure, said a former Fox colleague, Brit Hume.Goler was a Fox News original, joining the network at its inception in 1996 and working his way up to senior White House foreign affairs correspondent. He retired in 2014. He worked for The Associated Press and Washingtonarea television stations before joining Fox.He was a panelist for Republican presidential debates in South Carolina and New Hampshire in 2007, and interviewed Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, and former First Lady Laura Bush.Wendell was a gifted correspondent, a wonderful colleague and a Fox News original whose reporting was respected on both sides of the aisle, said Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Marge and his entire family.Goler jokingly referred to himself as a dinosaur upon his retirement but said he was glad to work during a golden era in broadcasting.Hume called Goler a valued friend who did consistently solid and balanced work and his reports were always wellcrafted, clear and easy to follow.

A Security Boulevard Report “85% of all organizations are hit by phishing attacks and 97% of users are unaware of advanced phishing emails.”\\nHackers can easily imitate a domain name by changing the sender name, but they cannot change the bit after the @.[ domain name].. Ask staff to reconfirm the domain before opening or clicking the attachment. Install anti-malware software\\nIf an employee clicks on a harmful link, setting up anti-malware software can help mitigate the attack.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

       "      <td>42 Leaving Roy Moore and his paltry pedophile tendencies in the dust, Arthur Jones  inyourface Nazi, vehement Holocaust denier, devoted white supremacist and oh yeah GOP candidate for Illinois 3rd District, argued in an interview Thursday on CNNs New Day that hes not really a Nazi anymore, just an American patriot and statesman who once ran the American Nazi Party, attends neoNazi rallies dressed in Nazi garb, celebrates Hitlers birthday and believes the Holocaust is an international extortion racket by the Jews. He shouldnt be blamed if other people dont know the truth, he told an increasingly agitated Alisyn Camerota in their stupefying interview. Instead, he said, blame the Jewish media. Which is weird, cause he looks pretty Jewish, and a lot like a greatuncle of ours. A retired insurance agent, the 70yearold Jones is the only Republican running in the March primary for the heavily Democratic district, which includes parts of Chicago and nearby suburbs. Since the 1970s, hes run for office a slew of times  for Milwaukee mayor, Chicago alderman, the same GOP district seat  but for the first time this year, right in sync with our  Some Very Fine People president, hes unopposed. As evidence of the true horror of this American moment and the breathtaking moral cowardice of Republican leadership, hes been mildly rebuked by state GOP officials who concede this is not a good look for their party. But they havent found anyone to run against him.Youre always gonna get a body, says Christopher Mooney, a politics prof at the University of Illinois. Here weve got a Nazi body. Anytime youve got a Nazi running, somebody was asleep at the switch. Not to worry: Jones says he doesnt plan to ask for help from other Republicans anyway, especially from Trump, whos surrounded himself with hordes of Jews, especially that soninlaw of his. And while he softpedaled his views on race to get petition signatures  he focused on foreignpolicy views  hes right out there on his website. He is antihomosexual, abortion, sanctuary cities, illegal aliens, and more Middle East wars, which sounds okay until he explains they are Jews wars. He loves the Confederate flag and misses the late, great Sen. Joe McCarthy. He argues black and Hispanic housing complexes are full of thousands of street gang thugs planning their killings. He insists the Holocaust is nothing but an international extortion racket by the Jews to bleed, blackmail, extort and terrorize their enemies. And he hawks his own organization, America First Committee, which is open to any white Americans of European, nonJewish descent. In his interview with Camerota, he stressed thats the only formal organization he belongs to, so how could he be a Nazi Man, was she not buying it: If it looks and sounds and acts like a Nazi, she retorts, Youre a Nazi. And his website proffers the most vile, rancid rhetoric I think Ive ever seen. Incensed, Jones starts shrieking that other people dont know the truth. Then he loses it: You Jews media, youve gone absolutely nuts. You think that Adolf Hitlers revived from the grave or something. Its one man, myselfstanding for the truth and the news media cant stand that. The cursed twoparty, Jew party, queer party system cant stand it. Hes right. We cant stand it. Can this movie be over soon, please Jones served in Vietnam, which we didnt realize was a Jewish war, but, umm, okay</td>\n",

In Japan, he basically was playing with hitters. With the four to six pitches he throws, it looked like Wiffle ball.That was reflected in a 9338 record and 1.99 ERA with the Fighters, who received a 51.7 million posting fee for the right for Darvish to negotiate and sign a sixyear, 60 million contract with the Rangers .But his obsession with using his large array of pitches has prevented him from fulfilling the dominance many projected.Photos of Cubs starting pitcher Yu Darvish.His fastball and slider are quality pitches, the scout said. If the Cubs can convince him to be aggressive, thats my only concern.According to the Bill James Handbook 2018, Darvish threw his fastball only 52 percent of the time, followed by his slider 25 percent, cut fastball 15 percent, curve 6 percent and changeup 2 percent.Despite missing all of 2015 while recovering from Tommy John elbow surgery, Darvishs fastball averaged 94.2 mph  up 1 mph from 2016.But his ERA swelled from 3.41 to 3.86, including nine starts for the Dodgers after a trade from the Rangers.The Cubs earned a 31 win over Darvish and the Rangers on July 16, 2016, despite Darvishs nine strikeouts in 4 13 innings. They got only two hits off Darvish but were able to run up his pitch count to 90 in that short span thanks to four walks.That was quite a contrast from Game 3 of the 2017 National League Championship Series , in which Darvish scattered six hits, walked one and struck out seven in an 81pitch, 6 13inning effort.The balancing act for Darvish and the Cubs will be for him to sustain his dominance while pitching more economically than he has over his past five seasons with only two career complete games and making the adjustment to the NL.

By DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  An offduty police commander was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon in downtown Chicago after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect officers were chasing on foot, the citys police superintendent said. Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot multiple times after he saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. He choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Bauer was pronounced dead. The shooting occurred near the James R. Thompson Center, the state government office building. Johnson said officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously. Police captured the man a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. Bauer, 53, was a 31year veteran of the department. There were initial media reports that the man may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Witnesses to parts of the incident near said they heard gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Noreen Danko, who was walking to her office nearby, told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said Yep. I said Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. Theres a stairwell there. And it goes downstairs. I heard that the door is locked there. It used to be a pedway, but now, for security reasons they have it locked. She told the paper that she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, and then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, Johnson said before he turned and left the briefing. Mayor Rahm Emanuel offered his condolences, too, calling Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all.

He will start from barrier six on the front line and should prove the master of his nine rivals as he seeks his 29th win from 48 starts. He has won four Group 1 events and seven Group 2 races and has already amassed 1,404,479 in prizemoney. After Chicago Bull coasted to an effortless win at a 1.56.3 rate over 2536m in the Group 2 Lord Mayors Cup last Friday week, champion reinsman Gary Hall Jnr described the performance as like a trial he did it that easily. Describing the geldings small stature and insignificant looks, Hall said: when you look at him, hes the last one you would pick out of a stable. It just goes to show you whats on the inside, not whats on the outside. Leading trainer Gary Hall Snr said Bettors Fire and Argyle Red are racing well, but you would think that Chicago Bull will be winning. He will go forward and will probably get to the breeze outside Argyle Red, and then Junior will make up his mind what to do from there. I was going to spell him a week or two ago, but now I plan to race him for the next month. I have picked out the 50,000 Four and FiveYear0ld Championship on March 16 as his final run before going for a spell. Hall said that he expected his other runner Ohoka Punter would enjoy being the only runner on the back line. Hes probably the equal second best in the race and Id say that he and Bettors Fire will fight it out for second place. The Kyle Harpertrained and driven Bettors Fire notched his 34th win last Friday night when he gave a strong frontrunning display from the No. 1 barrier to win over 2130m from Our Jimmy Johnstone and Cut For An Ace. A week earlier, he ran on from sixth at the bell to be fourth behind Chicago Bull. Argyle Red, trained at Pinjarra by Rob MacDonald and driven by Morgan Woodley, has excellent place prospects. He should be the early leader from the No. 1 barrier and is likely to take the sit behind Chicago Bull as the race unfolds. Ken Casellas</td>\n",

He shouldnt be blamed if other people dont know the truth, he told an increasingly agitated Alisyn Camerota in their stupefying interview. Instead, he said, blame the Jewish media. Which is weird, cause he looks pretty Jewish, and a lot like a greatuncle of ours. A retired insurance agent, the 70yearold Jones is the only Republican running in the March primary for the heavily Democratic district, which includes parts of Chicago and nearby suburbs. Since the 1970s, hes run for office a slew of times  for Milwaukee mayor, Chicago alderman, the same GOP district seat  but for the first time this year, right in sync with our  Some Very Fine People president, hes unopposed. As evidence of the true horror of this American moment and the breathtaking moral cowardice of Republican leadership, hes been mildly rebuked by state GOP officials who concede this is not a good look for their party. But they havent found anyone to run against him.Youre always gonna get a body, says Christopher Mooney, a politics prof at the University of Illinois. Here weve got a Nazi body. Anytime youve got a Nazi running, somebody was asleep at the switch. Not to worry: Jones says he doesnt plan to ask for help from other Republicans anyway, especially from Trump, whos surrounded himself with hordes of Jews, especially that soninlaw of his. And while he softpedaled his views on race to get petition signatures  he focused on foreignpolicy views  hes right out there on his website. He is antihomosexual, abortion, sanctuary cities, illegal aliens, and more Middle East wars, which sounds okay until he explains they are Jews wars. He loves the Confederate flag and misses the late, great Sen. Joe McCarthy. He argues black and Hispanic housing complexes are full of thousands of street gang thugs planning their killings. He insists the Holocaust is nothing but an international extortion racket by the Jews to bleed, blackmail, extort and terrorize their enemies. And he hawks his own organization, America First Committee, which is open to any white Americans of European, nonJewish descent. In his interview with Camerota, he stressed thats the only formal organization he belongs to, so how could he be a Nazi Man, was she not buying it: If it looks and sounds and acts like a Nazi, she retorts, Youre a Nazi. And his website proffers the most vile, rancid rhetoric I think Ive ever seen. Incensed, Jones starts shrieking that other people dont know the truth. Then he loses it: You Jews media, youve gone absolutely nuts. You think that Adolf Hitlers revived from the grave or something. Its one man, myselfstanding for the truth and the news media cant stand that. The cursed twoparty, Jew party, queer party system cant stand it. Hes right. We cant stand it. Can this movie be over soon, please Jones served in Vietnam, which we didnt realize was a Jewish war, but, umm, okay   \n",

In Japan, he basically was playing with hitters. With the four to six pitches he throws, it looked like Wiffle ball.That was reflected in a 9338 record and 1.99 ERA with the Fighters, who received a 51.7 million posting fee for the right for Darvish to negotiate and sign a sixyear, 60 million contract with the Rangers .But his obsession with using his large array of pitches has prevented him from fulfilling the dominance many projected.Photos of Cubs starting pitcher Yu Darvish.His fastball and slider are quality pitches, the scout said. If the Cubs can convince him to be aggressive, thats my only concern.According to the Bill James Handbook 2018, Darvish threw his fastball only 52 percent of the time, followed by his slider 25 percent, cut fastball 15 percent, curve 6 percent and changeup 2 percent.Despite missing all of 2015 while recovering from Tommy John elbow surgery, Darvishs fastball averaged 94.2 mph  up 1 mph from 2016.But his ERA swelled from 3.41 to 3.86, including nine starts for the Dodgers after a trade from the Rangers.The Cubs earned a 31 win over Darvish and the Rangers on July 16, 2016, despite Darvishs nine strikeouts in 4 13 innings. They got only two hits off Darvish but were able to run up his pitch count to 90 in that short span thanks to four walks.That was quite a contrast from Game 3 of the 2017 National League Championship Series , in which Darvish scattered six hits, walked one and struck out seven in an 81pitch, 6 13inning effort.The balancing act for Darvish and the Cubs will be for him to sustain his dominance while pitching more economically than he has over his past five seasons with only two career complete games and making the adjustment to the NL.

Kim  Chicago TribuneChicago Tribune via AP. Police guard the crime scene after an offduty Chicago police officer was shot at the James R. Thompson Center, Feb. 13, 2018. By DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  An offduty police commander was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon in downtown Chicago after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect officers were chasing on foot, the citys police superintendent said. Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot multiple times after he saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. He choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Bauer was pronounced dead. The shooting occurred near the James R. Thompson Center, the state government office building. Johnson said officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously. Police captured the man a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. Bauer, 53, was a 31year veteran of the department. There were initial media reports that the man may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Witnesses to parts of the incident near said they heard gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Noreen Danko, who was walking to her office nearby, told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said Yep. I said Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. Theres a stairwell there. And it goes downstairs. I heard that the door is locked there. It used to be a pedway, but now, for security reasons they have it locked. She told the paper that she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, and then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, Johnson said before he turned and left the briefing. Mayor Rahm Emanuel offered his condolences, too, calling Bauers death a tragic reminder of the dangerous duty the men and women of our police department accept to ensure the safety of us all.

He will start from barrier six on the front line and should prove the master of his nine rivals as he seeks his 29th win from 48 starts. He has won four Group 1 events and seven Group 2 races and has already amassed 1,404,479 in prizemoney. After Chicago Bull coasted to an effortless win at a 1.56.3 rate over 2536m in the Group 2 Lord Mayors Cup last Friday week, champion reinsman Gary Hall Jnr described the performance as like a trial he did it that easily. Describing the geldings small stature and insignificant looks, Hall said: when you look at him, hes the last one you would pick out of a stable. It just goes to show you whats on the inside, not whats on the outside. Leading trainer Gary Hall Snr said Bettors Fire and Argyle Red are racing well, but you would think that Chicago Bull will be winning. He will go forward and will probably get to the breeze outside Argyle Red, and then Junior will make up his mind what to do from there. I was going to spell him a week or two ago, but now I plan to race him for the next month. I have picked out the 50,000 Four and FiveYear0ld Championship on March 16 as his final run before going for a spell. Hall said that he expected his other runner Ohoka Punter would enjoy being the only runner on the back line. Hes probably the equal second best in the race and Id say that he and Bettors Fire will fight it out for second place. The Kyle Harpertrained and driven Bettors Fire notched his 34th win last Friday night when he gave a strong frontrunning display from the No. 1 barrier to win over 2130m from Our Jimmy Johnstone and Cut For An Ace. A week earlier, he ran on from sixth at the bell to be fourth behind Chicago Bull. Argyle Red, trained at Pinjarra by Rob MacDonald and driven by Morgan Woodley, has excellent place prospects. He should be the early leader from the No. 1 barrier and is likely to take the sit behind Chicago Bull as the race unfolds. Ken Casellas   \n",

He shouldnt be blamed if other people dont know the truth, he told an increasingly agitated Alisyn Camerota in their stupefying interview. Instead, he said, blame the Jewish media. Which is weird, cause he looks pretty Jewish, and a lot like a greatuncle of ours. A retired insurance agent, the 70yearold Jones is the only Republican running in the March primary for the heavily Democratic district, which includes parts of Chicago and nearby suburbs. Since the 1970s, hes run for office a slew of times  for Milwaukee mayor, Chicago alderman, the same GOP district seat  but for the first time this year, right in sync with our  Some Very Fine People president, hes unopposed. As evidence of the true horror of this American moment and the breathtaking moral cowardice of Republican leadership, hes been mildly rebuked by state GOP officials who concede this is not a good look for their party. But they havent found anyone to run against him.Youre always gonna get a body, says Christopher Mooney, a politics prof at the University of Illinois. Here weve got a Nazi body. Anytime youve got a Nazi running, somebody was asleep at the switch. Not to worry: Jones says he doesnt plan to ask for help from other Republicans anyway, especially from Trump, whos surrounded himself with hordes of Jews, especially that soninlaw of his. And while he softpedaled his views on race to get petition signatures  he focused on foreignpolicy views  hes right out there on his website. He is antihomosexual, abortion, sanctuary cities, illegal aliens, and more Middle East wars, which sounds okay until he explains they are Jews wars. He loves the Confederate flag and misses the late, great Sen. Joe McCarthy. He argues black and Hispanic housing complexes are full of thousands of street gang thugs planning their killings. He insists the Holocaust is nothing but an international extortion racket by the Jews to bleed, blackmail, extort and terrorize their enemies. And he hawks his own organization, America First Committee, which is open to any white Americans of European, nonJewish descent. In his interview with Camerota, he stressed thats the only formal organization he belongs to, so how could he be a Nazi Man, was she not buying it: If it looks and sounds and acts like a Nazi, she retorts, Youre a Nazi. And his website proffers the most vile, rancid rhetoric I think Ive ever seen. Incensed, Jones starts shrieking that other people dont know the truth. Then he loses it: You Jews media, youve gone absolutely nuts. You think that Adolf Hitlers revived from the grave or something. Its one man, myselfstanding for the truth and the news media cant stand that. The cursed twoparty, Jew party, queer party system cant stand it. Hes right. We cant stand it. Can this movie be over soon, please Jones served in Vietnam, which we didnt realize was a Jewish war, but, umm, okay   \n",

In Japan, he basically was playing with hitters. With the four to six pitches he throws, it looked like Wiffle ball.That was reflected in a 9338 record and 1.99 ERA with the Fighters, who received a 51.7 million posting fee for the right for Darvish to negotiate and sign a sixyear, 60 million contract with the Rangers .But his obsession with using his large array of pitches has prevented him from fulfilling the dominance many projected.Photos of Cubs starting pitcher Yu Darvish.His fastball and slider are quality pitches, the scout said. If the Cubs can convince him to be aggressive, thats my only concern.According to the Bill James Handbook 2018, Darvish threw his fastball only 52 percent of the time, followed by his slider 25 percent, cut fastball 15 percent, curve 6 percent and changeup 2 percent.Despite missing all of 2015 while recovering from Tommy John elbow surgery, Darvishs fastball averaged 94.2 mph  up 1 mph from 2016.But his ERA swelled from 3.41 to 3.86, including nine starts for the Dodgers after a trade from the Rangers.The Cubs earned a 31 win over Darvish and the Rangers on July 16, 2016, despite Darvishs nine strikeouts in 4 13 innings. They got only two hits off Darvish but were able to run up his pitch count to 90 in that short span thanks to four walks.That was quite a contrast from Game 3 of the 2017 National League Championship Series , in which Darvish scattered six hits, walked one and struck out seven in an 81pitch, 6 13inning effort.The balancing act for Darvish and the Cubs will be for him to sustain his dominance while pitching more economically than he has over his past five seasons with only two career complete games and making the adjustment to the NL. His ERA is considerably lower against NL teams 3.13 in 24 starts than against the American League 3.48 in 107 starts.mgonzales@chicagotribune.comTwitter @MDGonzalesCubs agree to terms with pitcher Yu Darvish on sixyear, 126 million deal The Cubs, acting like what World Series favorites ought to act Column: For the Cubs to become serious World Series contenders again, it had to be Yu No, Mirai Nagasu does not have a giant USA tattoo on her inner thigh Kyle Schwarber calls Cubs addition of Yu Darvish the cherry on top Noah Vonlehs time at Indiana was short.

By DON BABWINAssociated Press CHICAGO AP  An offduty police commander was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon in downtown Chicago after he spotted a man matching the radio description of an armed suspect officers were chasing on foot, the citys police superintendent said. Cmdr. Paul Bauer was shot multiple times after he saw the offender and engaged in an armed physical confrontation, Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. He choked back tears as he spoke to reporters outside Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where Bauer was pronounced dead. The shooting occurred near the James R. Thompson Center, the state government office building. Johnson said officers initially confronted the suspect because he was acting suspiciously. Police captured the man a short time later, and a gun was recovered at the scene, he said. Bauer, 53, was a 31year veteran of the department. There were initial media reports that the man may have been involved in the robbery of a local business, but Johnson did not provide details about what the man was doing that prompted officers to want to speak with him. Witnesses to parts of the incident near said they heard gunshots. I was walking down the street and I heard pop pop pop pop pop, Noreen Danko, who was walking to her office nearby, told the Chicago Tribune. And I said to the girl next to me, Is that what I think it is And she said Yep. I said Aw geez. And everybody is scurrying all over and I see the police head to the stairs there. Theres a stairwell there. And it goes downstairs. I heard that the door is locked there. It used to be a pedway, but now, for security reasons they have it locked. She told the paper that she saw officers lead the shackled suspect away and put him in a squad car, and then watched as emergency workers administered CPR to Bauer, who was lying on a stretcher, before he was put inside an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. I just ask the citizens of this city to keep the Bauer family in their prayers, Johnson said before he turned and left the briefing.

He will start from barrier six on the front line and should prove the master of his nine rivals as he seeks his 29th win from 48 starts. He has won four Group 1 events and seven Group 2 races and has already amassed 1,404,479 in prizemoney. After Chicago Bull coasted to an effortless win at a 1.56.3 rate over 2536m in the Group 2 Lord Mayors Cup last Friday week, champion reinsman Gary Hall Jnr described the performance as like a trial he did it that easily. Describing the geldings small stature and insignificant looks, Hall said: when you look at him, hes the last one you would pick out of a stable. It just goes to show you whats on the inside, not whats on the outside. Leading trainer Gary Hall Snr said Bettors Fire and Argyle Red are racing well, but you would think that Chicago Bull will be winning. He will go forward and will probably get to the breeze outside Argyle Red, and then Junior will make up his mind what to do from there. I was going to spell him a week or two ago, but now I plan to race him for the next month. I have picked out the 50,000 Four and FiveYear0ld Championship on March 16 as his final run before going for a spell. Hall said that he expected his other runner Ohoka Punter would enjoy being the only runner on the back line. Hes probably the equal second best in the race and Id say that he and Bettors Fire will fight it out for second place. The Kyle Harpertrained and driven Bettors Fire notched his 34th win last Friday night when he gave a strong frontrunning display from the No. 1 barrier to win over 2130m from Our Jimmy Johnstone and Cut For An Ace. A week earlier, he ran on from sixth at the bell to be fourth behind Chicago Bull. Argyle Red, trained at Pinjarra by Rob MacDonald and driven by Morgan Woodley, has excellent place prospects. He should be the early leader from the No. 1 barrier and is likely to take the sit behind Chicago Bull as the race unfolds. Ken Casellas   \n",
