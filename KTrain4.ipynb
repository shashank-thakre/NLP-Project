What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

       "      <td>Nazareth Home in East Chicago closing after 27 years of service to children The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ founded Nazareth Home in 1993 to take care of abused and abandoned children with unique medical needs. It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "      <td>Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Inspector General Michael Horowitz said he would examine whether the data subpoenaed by the Justice Department and turned over by Apple followed department policy and whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.Next Up In Washington NATO leaders declare China global security challenge Justices defer Harvard case on race in college admissions Biden, unlike predecessors, maintained Putin skepticism CPD officer used Nword, shared pictures when bragging about role in US Capitol riots: feds G7 pledge to share, but jostle for ground in the sandbox Congress, Justice Dept. probing Trump seizures of Dems data Most ReadMother of 3 killed in weekend mass shooting was in the prime of her life, cousin says Kimfier Miles, 29, was killed in a mass shooting early Saturday on the South Side that also wounded nine others.Horoscope for Monday, June 14, 2021Feuding stars of Windy City Rehab agree: We need help splitting up The pair have asked a Cook County judge to appoint a receiver to wind down their shared business interests, essentially a third party to oversee their financial divorce.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "3  Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

       "      <td>There's a Big Tree Growing Through a Car in Illinois Published: December 14, 2020 nanjanWere not exactly sure whats going here, but we have a pretty good idea. What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

He retired in 2014. He worked for The Associated Press and Washingtonarea television stations before joining Fox.He was a panelist for Republican presidential debates in South Carolina and New Hampshire in 2007, and interviewed Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, and former First Lady Laura Bush.Wendell was a gifted correspondent, a wonderful colleague and a Fox News original whose reporting was respected on both sides of the aisle, said Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media.

       "      <td>Nazareth Home in East Chicago closing after 27 years of service to children The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ founded Nazareth Home in 1993 to take care of abused and abandoned children with unique medical needs. It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "      <td>Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "3  Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

       "      <td>There's a Big Tree Growing Through a Car in Illinois Published: December 14, 2020 nanjanWere not exactly sure whats going here, but we have a pretty good idea. What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

He retired in 2014. He worked for The Associated Press and Washingtonarea television stations before joining Fox.He was a panelist for Republican presidential debates in South Carolina and New Hampshire in 2007, and interviewed Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, and former First Lady Laura Bush.Wendell was a gifted correspondent, a wonderful colleague and a Fox News original whose reporting was respected on both sides of the aisle, said Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media.

       "      <td>Nazareth Home in East Chicago closing after 27 years of service to children The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ founded Nazareth Home in 1993 to take care of abused and abandoned children with unique medical needs. It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "      <td>Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "3  Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

She pledged to change the way City Hall operated under Rahm Emanuel and for decades before him, invest in poor neighborhoods, improve schools and address the citys deeply troubled finances.But with teachers in Chicago Public Schools hitting the picket lines this week, Lightfoot finds herself facing many of the same challenges as her predecessor, the former White House chief of staff whose years of conflict with the Chicago Teachers Union included a sevenday strike in 2012.About 25,000 teachers and staff were on strike for the second day Friday, after months of negotiations ended without a new contract between the union and CPS. The walkout has canceled classes for more than 300,000 students as the two sides wrangle over class sizes, pay and staffing for nurses and school social workers. Union officials said progress was being made at the bargaining table, but the strike could continue into next week.It is the biggest test yet for Lightfoot, who had never been elected to public office before she defeated more than a dozen candidates and won an April runoff in a landslide over a longtime political insider. Its also her opportunity to show how she is different from or better than Emanuel, whose City Hall she criticized heavily during the campaign.But to get there, she may have to choose her own path: Does she ultimately acquiesce to teachers, whose demands she estimates may cost up to 2.5 billion per year Or will she hold the line financially and risk alienating an influential force in Chicago politicsAlong with the strike, Lightfoot is dealing with other longstanding city problems, including how to close a budget shortfall of nearly 1 billion and address 30 billion in publicpension debt. AdvertisingIf she cannot land a deal with teachers for public schools in Chicago, then you have to question her ability to get work done in this city, said CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates.Lightfoot rejects the suggestion that a prolonged strike might hurt her politically, saying I dont look at it that way.This isnt about politics for me, the former federal prosecutor said.The CTU backed Lightfoots rival, a former teacher who now leads the Cook County Democratic Party and the county board, during the mayoral election.They note Lightfoot, also a Democrat, promised during the campaign to transform a district that has seen declining enrollment and where more than threequarters of students are lowincome.The union has argued for years that class sizes are too large  many classrooms have more than 30 students  and that they and their students dont have the support they need. Animosity also remains over Emanuels decision to close dozens of schools , most in minority neighborhoods. AdvertisingYakirah Robinson, who teaches 4th and 5th grades, said she was optimistic when Lightfoot got elected because she thought she understood what teachers are up against. Robinson said she has 33 kids in her classroom, and many need extra help. Shes disappointed but hopeful Lightfoot will come around.Charlie Koltak, a music teacher at Orozco Community Academy, and who also has a 10yearold child attending public school, does not put all the blame for the impasse on Lightfoot.This is still Rahms team, he said of the CPS negotiating team and hierarchy, many of which are holdovers from when Emanuel was mayor. Its just like former President Barack Obama said he would do all this progressive stuff and when he gets in there his hands are tied.Jaime Dominguez, a Northwestern University political science professor, said Lightfoot is wellpositioned to hold her ground against a union thats trying to take control of every possible decisionmaking power they can have.She has the political currency right now to take a stand, he said. She was elected by the whole city to usher in reform, and part of that reform is being financially cognizant of whats at stake in terms of resources.Lightfoot insists she has made good on her campaign promises. She said the union had been signaling their intent to strike for a long time and that they had not shown an urgency to get a deal.She also said she has to balance the needs of schools and students with her responsibility to taxpayers, and that she has been hearing from parents, teachers and other Chicago residents who say she has their support.This isnt about me, Lightfoot said. This isnt about my power or not. This is about our children.___Associated Press reporter Don Babwin contributed. SARA BURNETT</td>\n",

       "      <td>Affordable housing among striking Chicago teachers' demands - WSB Atlanta Affordable housing among striking Chicago teachers demands By: KATHLEEN FOODY and DON BABWIN, Associated Press Updated: Oct 21, 2019  9:29 PM Loading... 0 Affordable housing among striking Chicago teachers demands CHICAGO AP  Striking Chicago teachers who are seeking smaller class sizes and higher pay also are demanding that the nations thirdlargest city do more to lower housing costs and put more resources into helping homeless students.The demand for affordable housing citywide  for students and their financiallystrapped families as well as for school employees  stands as a dramatic example of organized labors effort to expand bargaining beyond breadandbutter issues.The pursuit is part of the unions social justice agenda and is a unique departure from standard negotiating tactics. Despite early rejection by city officials, teachers argue that the issue belongs on the bargaining table.After months of negotiating , the Chicago Teachers Unions 25,000 members began striking Thursday along with thousands of support staff.Talks that continued through the weekend and into Monday made some progress but didnt resolve key disagreements, including teachers demands for stricter class size limits and more support staff in schools, and classes remained canceled for more than 300,000 students.The union on Monday also flatly rejected Mayor Lori Lightfoots request to return to classrooms while contract talks continue.Neither side has spoken publicly about any discussion of the affordable housing issue during bargaining sessions. But the union has made clear that the issue is an important one for its membership.Chicago is certainly not the only U.S. city where the issue of affordable housing for teachers and other school employees is significant. But Robert Bruno, a professor of labor and employment at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, said he doesnt know of any other cities in which the issue has pushed its way into contract negotiations.He said thats because the chasm continues to grow nationwide between teachers salaries and the cost of affordable housing at a time when urban school districts also are having an increasingly difficult time recruiting and retaining teachers.Teacher unions around the country are watching this very closely, Bruno said.The Chicago union hasnt released details of its housing proposal  and its unclear what changes, if any, such language would require of the city. But it does include a demand that the district put in writing that it supports any potential city and state policies aimed at making housing more affordable.Union officials have noted city programs that help members of the police and fire department purchase a home. Theyve also referenced approaches to help teachers used elsewhere, including a California school district thats building affordable housing for teachers and a Colorado program that covers a portion of teachers down payment for a home.Teachers also want more staff dedicated to helping students who are homeless and working with families who are close to losing their housing.The union announced some progress on that issue Sunday night, but exact details havent been released.But there is still clear disagreement about the amount of raises for special education aides and other support staff who joined teachers on the picket lines and say they struggle to afford housing in the city.Willie Cousins said he makes less than 30,000 working as a teachers aide at Bond Elementary on the South Side, while his wife works at Walmart. Cousins, 34, said they and their two children live in a twobedroom apartment that costs about 800 a month.Bills for electricity, gas, groceries and other necessities usually mean they have little left over, Cousins said.I love what I do, and I want to continue, he said. But it comes back to the financial piece. How long will I be able to sustain and live on this salaryThe gap between the number of affordable rental units and the number of low and middleincome residents searching for one in Chicago has continued growing since 2012, according to researchers at DePaul Universitys Institute for Housing Studies.Decades of segregation and disinvestment in city neighborhoods combined to make a web of housing issues that will take a longterm, concerted effort to improve, said Geoff Smith, the institutes executive director.There are these parts of the city that are really strong and thriving, while others are really struggling, Smith said. And then you have neighborhoods in between dealing with challenges like rising rent.Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, ran for mayor on a progressive platform, including school reform and investment in poor neighborhoods, and the union has accused her of failing to follow through on those campaign promises.Lightfoot said prior to the strike that affordable housing isnt an issue that should be covered in contract negotiations, but that she would welcome the unions input on broader housing policy in the city, along with other groups.Affordable housing is a critical issue that affects residents across Chicago, and everyones voices need to be heard during this process, Lightfoot said.One possible solution would be for the city to lift the requirement that teachers, like police officers, firefighters and other city employees, live in Chicago. But Bruno said doing that could create new problems  starting with an exodus of teachers who decide once they move to the suburbs they would rather work closer to home. Few other large districts have similar requirements.In California, where the cost of housing in and around cities such as San Francisco is far higher than Chicago, school districts in welltodo communities have built housing projects for teachers. California passed a law three years ago that makes it easier for school districts to create affordable housing for teachers, prompting a surge of projects.Teachers, because their salaries have not kept up with the price of housing, just cannot afford to live where they work, said Sarah Chaffin, founder of SupportTeacherHousing.org. Before, you could buy a house on a teachers salary and now you cant do that.Striking teachers also argue that Chicagos affordable housing crisis affects their students, particularly more than 16,000 who were homeless last year. The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless includes students who were living in shelters, motels, cars or doubledup in other families homes in that count.Barbara Duffield, executive director of a national nonprofit called SchoolHouse Connection that focuses on students who are homeless, said teachers and other staff are often in the best position to sense a change in a students life outside school.They are the first to notice, for example, a child falling asleep in class or hoarding food, she said. They have a kind of oversight, every single day, that nobody else does. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

       "      <td>A retro trend in Chicago politics Bill Daley, the man from JPMorgan. They used to call it plantation politics. The Tribunes Clarence Page has traced the origins of the metaphor to refer to the old Daley political machine in Chicago, a regime built on racism, patronage and corruption that ruled the city for decades.A Dec. 13, 1987, Chicago Tribune article traced the phrase to a speech that political consultant Don Rose wrote in 1966 for then aldermanic candidate Timuel Blacks crusade against the Democratic machine of Mayor Richard J. Daley. It later became a rallying cry in Harold Washingtons successful 1983 campaign to become the citys first black elected mayor. Its hard for me to believe that more than 50 years later, this citys voters, especially AfricanAmerican voters, will opt to return to Daleystyle politics, especially at a time when progressive candidates of color are chalking up victories over oldguard Democrats here, and in cities and towns across the country. And yet, here we are, with Bill Daley a personification of old plantation politics, only now with a boatload of corporate cash at his disposal, and a stint in the Obama administration on his resumeopportunistically jumping into the mayors race now that Rahm Emanuel has pulled out.I would not do that to a friend, he explained , as to why he didnt enter the race earlier.It must be noted that the inability of the city progressives  the 2015 Bernie Sanders coalition  to unite around a black or Latino candidate early in the race, has opened the door wide for a return of the machine. As has the inability of anybody in the current field to move beyond single digits in the polls.TALE OF TWO CITIES...To those who would argue that weve moved beyond racial politics in Chicago, I would have them look at this recent surve y showing how different the city looks, depending on which racial or class lens youre looking through.One example: A stunning 97 percent of white college graduates83 percent of them stronglysaid they would recommend living in my neighborhood in Chicago to a friend or family member. Thats nearuniversal approval, and an indication that parts of the city now have huge appeal, at least to certain demographic groups. But among AfricanAmerican college graduates, the strongly agree figure drops to 48 percent, and among all Hispanics not just college grads to 41 percent. Similarly, 58 percent of white college grads indicated they strongly believe Chicago is a good place to get a job, but only 47 percent of noncollege whites concurred, and 29 percent of blacks. No matter the perception, Chicagos become a nearimpossible place for many, if not most, to live, work, or raise a family. Not only is the plantation gone too many revolts, but so is the industrial era as well. Thus, the shocking mass exodus of displaced AfricanAmerican families from the city and its school system and the attempt to replace them with wealthier, corporate, white techies and professionals.Crains editorial graphic A Crains Chicago Business editorial posted their corporate agenda  Next mayor must keep business at top of City Hall priority list .Heres hoping one of the mayoral wannabes takes a plank from Emanuels platform and fights for the interests of business. And if none of the current contenders is smart enough to do so, heres hoping a better candidate emerges. A day later Bill Daley announced his candidacy. Coincidence I think not.</td>\n",

Monday, April 27, 2020 Chicago Bans HorseDrawn Carriages Starting in 2021 The steady sounds of clipclopping hooves pulling creaking carriages will be absent from the streets in Chicago starting next year after the City Council on Friday voted to ban horsedrawn carriages. Under the ordinance, which is effective Jan. 1, 2021, operators will be unable to renew their licenses, and the city will stop issuing new ones. The horsedrawn carriage industry has been shrinking for years. The city now has 10 carriage licenses that will expire at the end of the year, The Chicago Tribune reported . At one point, it had 60 licenses available, according to The Associated Press. Chicago joins a handful of other cities that have already banned horsedrawn carriages, including: Salt Lake City Biloxi, Miss. Camden, N.J., as well as Key West, Palm Beach, Pompano Beach and Treasure Island, Fla., according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals . In Montreal, horsedrawn carriages were prohibited starting on Jan. 1, 2020. For years, animal rights activists have called the carriagehorse industry abusive and cruel but supporters have argued that the horses are treated humanely and the carriages are a romantic link to history, provide jobs and appeal to tourists. No horsedrawn carriage can carry more than seven passengers, and the horses must be kept off the streets when temperatures reach either 15 degrees or lower, or 90 degrees or higher, according to Chicago city regulations . Dennis French, a veterinarian, professor at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine and vice president of the Horsemens Council of Illinois, addressed the City Council on Friday to speak out against the ordinance. He said claims of mistreatment and insufficient care were unfounded. Representatives of the Horsemens Council have repeatedly inspected these horses, the harnesses that are used on them and the stables where they are kept, and we have found no causes for concern, Dr. French said. These horses are well cared for, healthy and they like to work. But Kitty Block, the president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, welcomed the citys move as a step to help protect the horses... MORE Posted by</td>\n",

A federal grand jury last week indicted Mayor Kevin Hutchinson on charges of making a false statement to the federal Southern Illinois Public Corruption Task Force. The indictment alleges Hutchinson and his company received referral commissions from insurance contracts obtained by the city. Hutchinsons resignation was announced Monday by City Administrator Doug Brimm. The announcement quoted part of a letter Hutchinson wrote to members of the Columbia City Council. Hutchinson wrote he felt it was in the best interest of the city and his family to resign. Local News</td>\n",

       "      <td>Overtime for Chicago police officers and firefighters soaring CHICAGO  In a city with continuing budget woes, overtime for police officers and firefighters is soaring.As reported by the SunTimes , taxpayers spent roughly 210 million on overtime last year.Thats an extraordinary amount of money. It raises the question do we have the right level of staffingLaurence Msall with Civic Federation said. Should we be hiring more people are our the abuses really where the focus should beThe surge in overtime comes as the city added more technology and manpower.Msall points to minimum staffing requirements for the fire department as part of the reason for the cost surge. He said the requirements are outdated.The Illinois General Assembly is complicate in the inefficiency because the state of Illinois often requires in the case of fireman how many firemen are on a truck, what the staffing levels are, Msall said. That does not reflect the actual needs, it reflects and outdated idea about how to staff fire prevention needs.The Firefighters Union notes the department provides crucial emergency medical services, but the citys inspector general has called for changes to the minimum staffing requirement.The mayor has said everything must be on the table.I think the mayor has shown her frustration on overtime, especially for police and for fire, but in particular, the city has not always done a great job of budgeting for overtime and being transparent about it, Msall said.The police department has been working on the overtime issue since Mayor Lightfoot demanded reforms over the summer. Since then, the department said it put in place structural changes to control overtime.Overtime is now monitored using electronic records. Personnel now swipe in and out of work and commanders are given an overtime budget to manage.On Thursday, the City Council Committee on Public Safety will meet. One alderman told WGN overtime is expected to be a topic of discussion.</td>\n",

Roderick Sawyer 6th, Raymond Lopez 15th, Stephanie Coleman 16th, David Moore 17th and Jeanette Taylor 20th are teaming up to hear residents concerns and share information and resources in an effort to jumpstart a longterm conversation about improving the South Side neighborhood.The communitywide town hall is set for 68 p.m. Tuesday at KennedyKing College, 6301 S. Halsted St.Taylor, elected to replace former Ald. Willie Cochran who is currently serving a year in federal prison for wire fraud, is one of the areas newest aldermen. She said Englewoods aldermen havent worked together in the past.For so long, the aldermen of Englewood have not worked together. That doesnt work for our city, or our constituents, she said. If we say were progressive, the progressive thing to do is to meet on, perhaps, a quarterly basis to make sure that all constituents are getting the services they need, and to hear different types of voices.Commissioner Maurice Cox from the Department of Planning and Development will also be on hand to talk about economic possibilities for the Southwest Side community. Cox went for ridealongs with all five aldermen last year, talking to each about what they wanted to see.One of the issues Taylor talked about during her campaign was the divided leadership in Englewood, and whether the community needed less aldermen.While all of the aldermen may not agree politically, Taylor told Block Club they all share a common goal: making sure the people of Englewood are heard.Taylor hopes that the town hall will allow residents to talk about public safety in a way that focuses less on bashing police and more on making sure the city does right by the community.This meeting is to reassure that people are at the table who actually come from Englewood who were born and bred there, who know the issues and are ready to do the work, Taylor said.Do stories like this matter to you Subscribe to Block Club Chicago .

       "      <td>Chicago mayor signs plan boosting sanctuary protections Chicago mayor signs plan boosting sanctuary protections SOPHIA TAREEN Associated Press SaveCHICAGO  Mayor Lori Lightfoot signed a measure Tuesday strengthening Chicagos sanctuary policies by removing exceptions where local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.The revised ordinance, which easily cleared the City Council last month, follows years of campaigning by immigrant rights advocates whove said issues of immigration and the criminal justice system are separate.Previously, Chicagos Welcoming City ordinance allowed police to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in limited circumstances, including if a person living in the country without legal permission had an outstanding criminal warrant, a conviction or was named in the citys gang database.Chicago has been a welcoming city and a city of immigrants since its very founding, and proudly so, Lightfoot said.Opponents, including aldermen, cited concerns about crime and protecting gang members.But supporters said immigrants can now call authorities and cooperate with investigations without fear. Activists, who said previous sanctuary protections fell short, praised the move as a step toward addressing conflicts between police and communities throughout Chicago.No matter someones history, layering deportation on top of an already flawed and racist criminal justice system is a discriminatory and wrong, said a statement from a coalition called the Chicago Immigration Working Group.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chicago authorizes traffic congestion tax on ride-hailing services A proposal to fight traffic congestion in Chicago by boosting taxes on certain ridehailing trips won city council approval on Tuesday as the city and ride providers alleged each other of penalizing lowincome passengers.Mayor Lori Lightfoots plan boosts the citys tax on singlepassenger trips and decreases the tax on shared rides while imposing new surcharges on weekday rides in the downtown area to raise 40 million for the fiscal year that starts January 1.Ridehailing companies Uber and Lyft have claimed the move would largely harm lowincome residents.Previously this month, Lightfoot, who is the citys first female AfricanAmerican mayor, had alleged Uber of trying to resist any type of regulation by stirring up racial tensions.Uber denied her claims and said alternative proposals it provided would spare lowerincome communities in Chicagos South and West sides from higher costs while raising more money for the budget of the city.Reuters analysis of data that ridesharing companies are must reveal to Chicago shows fares for shared rides in the city have increased enough over the past year, while fares for single riders have remained the same.The price increases for shared rides mainly affect Chicagos lowincome neighborhoods where most carpool rides are booked, the analysis revealed. Over this period of boosted fares, carpool ridership dropped.</td>\n",

She pledged to change the way City Hall operated under Rahm Emanuel and for decades before him, invest in poor neighborhoods, improve schools and address the citys deeply troubled finances.But with teachers in Chicago Public Schools hitting the picket lines this week, Lightfoot finds herself facing many of the same challenges as her predecessor, the former White House chief of staff whose years of conflict with the Chicago Teachers Union included a sevenday strike in 2012.About 25,000 teachers and staff were on strike for the second day Friday, after months of negotiations ended without a new contract between the union and CPS. The walkout has canceled classes for more than 300,000 students as the two sides wrangle over class sizes, pay and staffing for nurses and school social workers. Union officials said progress was being made at the bargaining table, but the strike could continue into next week.It is the biggest test yet for Lightfoot, who had never been elected to public office before she defeated more than a dozen candidates and won an April runoff in a landslide over a longtime political insider. Its also her opportunity to show how she is different from or better than Emanuel, whose City Hall she criticized heavily during the campaign.But to get there, she may have to choose her own path: Does she ultimately acquiesce to teachers, whose demands she estimates may cost up to 2.5 billion per year Or will she hold the line financially and risk alienating an influential force in Chicago politicsAlong with the strike, Lightfoot is dealing with other longstanding city problems, including how to close a budget shortfall of nearly 1 billion and address 30 billion in publicpension debt. AdvertisingIf she cannot land a deal with teachers for public schools in Chicago, then you have to question her ability to get work done in this city, said CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates.Lightfoot rejects the suggestion that a prolonged strike might hurt her politically, saying I dont look at it that way.This isnt about politics for me, the former federal prosecutor said.The CTU backed Lightfoots rival, a former teacher who now leads the Cook County Democratic Party and the county board, during the mayoral election.They note Lightfoot, also a Democrat, promised during the campaign to transform a district that has seen declining enrollment and where more than threequarters of students are lowincome.The union has argued for years that class sizes are too large  many classrooms have more than 30 students  and that they and their students dont have the support they need. Animosity also remains over Emanuels decision to close dozens of schools , most in minority neighborhoods. AdvertisingYakirah Robinson, who teaches 4th and 5th grades, said she was optimistic when Lightfoot got elected because she thought she understood what teachers are up against. Robinson said she has 33 kids in her classroom, and many need extra help. Shes disappointed but hopeful Lightfoot will come around.Charlie Koltak, a music teacher at Orozco Community Academy, and who also has a 10yearold child attending public school, does not put all the blame for the impasse on Lightfoot.This is still Rahms team, he said of the CPS negotiating team and hierarchy, many of which are holdovers from when Emanuel was mayor. Its just like former President Barack Obama said he would do all this progressive stuff and when he gets in there his hands are tied.Jaime Dominguez, a Northwestern University political science professor, said Lightfoot is wellpositioned to hold her ground against a union thats trying to take control of every possible decisionmaking power they can have.She has the political currency right now to take a stand, he said. She was elected by the whole city to usher in reform, and part of that reform is being financially cognizant of whats at stake in terms of resources.Lightfoot insists she has made good on her campaign promises. She said the union had been signaling their intent to strike for a long time and that they had not shown an urgency to get a deal.She also said she has to balance the needs of schools and students with her responsibility to taxpayers, and that she has been hearing from parents, teachers and other Chicago residents who say she has their support.This isnt about me, Lightfoot said. This isnt about my power or not. This is about our children.___Associated Press reporter Don Babwin contributed. SARA BURNETT   \n",

       "89779  Affordable housing among striking Chicago teachers' demands - WSB Atlanta Affordable housing among striking Chicago teachers demands By: KATHLEEN FOODY and DON BABWIN, Associated Press Updated: Oct 21, 2019  9:29 PM Loading... 0 Affordable housing among striking Chicago teachers demands CHICAGO AP  Striking Chicago teachers who are seeking smaller class sizes and higher pay also are demanding that the nations thirdlargest city do more to lower housing costs and put more resources into helping homeless students.The demand for affordable housing citywide  for students and their financiallystrapped families as well as for school employees  stands as a dramatic example of organized labors effort to expand bargaining beyond breadandbutter issues.The pursuit is part of the unions social justice agenda and is a unique departure from standard negotiating tactics. Despite early rejection by city officials, teachers argue that the issue belongs on the bargaining table.After months of negotiating , the Chicago Teachers Unions 25,000 members began striking Thursday along with thousands of support staff.Talks that continued through the weekend and into Monday made some progress but didnt resolve key disagreements, including teachers demands for stricter class size limits and more support staff in schools, and classes remained canceled for more than 300,000 students.The union on Monday also flatly rejected Mayor Lori Lightfoots request to return to classrooms while contract talks continue.Neither side has spoken publicly about any discussion of the affordable housing issue during bargaining sessions. But the union has made clear that the issue is an important one for its membership.Chicago is certainly not the only U.S. city where the issue of affordable housing for teachers and other school employees is significant. But Robert Bruno, a professor of labor and employment at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, said he doesnt know of any other cities in which the issue has pushed its way into contract negotiations.He said thats because the chasm continues to grow nationwide between teachers salaries and the cost of affordable housing at a time when urban school districts also are having an increasingly difficult time recruiting and retaining teachers.Teacher unions around the country are watching this very closely, Bruno said.The Chicago union hasnt released details of its housing proposal  and its unclear what changes, if any, such language would require of the city. But it does include a demand that the district put in writing that it supports any potential city and state policies aimed at making housing more affordable.Union officials have noted city programs that help members of the police and fire department purchase a home. Theyve also referenced approaches to help teachers used elsewhere, including a California school district thats building affordable housing for teachers and a Colorado program that covers a portion of teachers down payment for a home.Teachers also want more staff dedicated to helping students who are homeless and working with families who are close to losing their housing.The union announced some progress on that issue Sunday night, but exact details havent been released.But there is still clear disagreement about the amount of raises for special education aides and other support staff who joined teachers on the picket lines and say they struggle to afford housing in the city.Willie Cousins said he makes less than 30,000 working as a teachers aide at Bond Elementary on the South Side, while his wife works at Walmart. Cousins, 34, said they and their two children live in a twobedroom apartment that costs about 800 a month.Bills for electricity, gas, groceries and other necessities usually mean they have little left over, Cousins said.I love what I do, and I want to continue, he said. But it comes back to the financial piece. How long will I be able to sustain and live on this salaryThe gap between the number of affordable rental units and the number of low and middleincome residents searching for one in Chicago has continued growing since 2012, according to researchers at DePaul Universitys Institute for Housing Studies.Decades of segregation and disinvestment in city neighborhoods combined to make a web of housing issues that will take a longterm, concerted effort to improve, said Geoff Smith, the institutes executive director.There are these parts of the city that are really strong and thriving, while others are really struggling, Smith said. And then you have neighborhoods in between dealing with challenges like rising rent.Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, ran for mayor on a progressive platform, including school reform and investment in poor neighborhoods, and the union has accused her of failing to follow through on those campaign promises.Lightfoot said prior to the strike that affordable housing isnt an issue that should be covered in contract negotiations, but that she would welcome the unions input on broader housing policy in the city, along with other groups.Affordable housing is a critical issue that affects residents across Chicago, and everyones voices need to be heard during this process, Lightfoot said.One possible solution would be for the city to lift the requirement that teachers, like police officers, firefighters and other city employees, live in Chicago. But Bruno said doing that could create new problems  starting with an exodus of teachers who decide once they move to the suburbs they would rather work closer to home. Few other large districts have similar requirements.In California, where the cost of housing in and around cities such as San Francisco is far higher than Chicago, school districts in welltodo communities have built housing projects for teachers. California passed a law three years ago that makes it easier for school districts to create affordable housing for teachers, prompting a surge of projects.Teachers, because their salaries have not kept up with the price of housing, just cannot afford to live where they work, said Sarah Chaffin, founder of SupportTeacherHousing.org. Before, you could buy a house on a teachers salary and now you cant do that.Striking teachers also argue that Chicagos affordable housing crisis affects their students, particularly more than 16,000 who were homeless last year. The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless includes students who were living in shelters, motels, cars or doubledup in other families homes in that count.Barbara Duffield, executive director of a national nonprofit called SchoolHouse Connection that focuses on students who are homeless, said teachers and other staff are often in the best position to sense a change in a students life outside school.They are the first to notice, for example, a child falling asleep in class or hoarding food, she said. They have a kind of oversight, every single day, that nobody else does. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They used to call it plantation politics. The Tribunes Clarence Page has traced the origins of the metaphor to refer to the old Daley political machine in Chicago, a regime built on racism, patronage and corruption that ruled the city for decades.A Dec. 13, 1987, Chicago Tribune article traced the phrase to a speech that political consultant Don Rose wrote in 1966 for then aldermanic candidate Timuel Blacks crusade against the Democratic machine of Mayor Richard J. Daley. It later became a rallying cry in Harold Washingtons successful 1983 campaign to become the citys first black elected mayor. Its hard for me to believe that more than 50 years later, this citys voters, especially AfricanAmerican voters, will opt to return to Daleystyle politics, especially at a time when progressive candidates of color are chalking up victories over oldguard Democrats here, and in cities and towns across the country. And yet, here we are, with Bill Daley a personification of old plantation politics, only now with a boatload of corporate cash at his disposal, and a stint in the Obama administration on his resumeopportunistically jumping into the mayors race now that Rahm Emanuel has pulled out.I would not do that to a friend, he explained , as to why he didnt enter the race earlier.It must be noted that the inability of the city progressives  the 2015 Bernie Sanders coalition  to unite around a black or Latino candidate early in the race, has opened the door wide for a return of the machine. As has the inability of anybody in the current field to move beyond single digits in the polls.TALE OF TWO CITIES...To those who would argue that weve moved beyond racial politics in Chicago, I would have them look at this recent surve y showing how different the city looks, depending on which racial or class lens youre looking through.One example: A stunning 97 percent of white college graduates83 percent of them stronglysaid they would recommend living in my neighborhood in Chicago to a friend or family member. Thats nearuniversal approval, and an indication that parts of the city now have huge appeal, at least to certain demographic groups. But among AfricanAmerican college graduates, the strongly agree figure drops to 48 percent, and among all Hispanics not just college grads to 41 percent. Similarly, 58 percent of white college grads indicated they strongly believe Chicago is a good place to get a job, but only 47 percent of noncollege whites concurred, and 29 percent of blacks. No matter the perception, Chicagos become a nearimpossible place for many, if not most, to live, work, or raise a family. Not only is the plantation gone too many revolts, but so is the industrial era as well. Thus, the shocking mass exodus of displaced AfricanAmerican families from the city and its school system and the attempt to replace them with wealthier, corporate, white techies and professionals.Crains editorial graphic A Crains Chicago Business editorial posted their corporate agenda  Next mayor must keep business at top of City Hall priority list .Heres hoping one of the mayoral wannabes takes a plank from Emanuels platform and fights for the interests of business. And if none of the current contenders is smart enough to do so, heres hoping a better candidate emerges. A day later Bill Daley announced his candidacy. Coincidence I think not.   \n",

Plus a few items on western history, western literature and the sport of rodeo... Frank DuBois served as the NM Secretary of Agriculture from 1988 to 2003. DuBois is a former legislative assistant to a U.S. Senator, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Interior, and is the founder of the DuBois Rodeo Scholarship. Monday, April 27, 2020 Chicago Bans HorseDrawn Carriages Starting in 2021 The steady sounds of clipclopping hooves pulling creaking carriages will be absent from the streets in Chicago starting next year after the City Council on Friday voted to ban horsedrawn carriages. Under the ordinance, which is effective Jan. 1, 2021, operators will be unable to renew their licenses, and the city will stop issuing new ones. The horsedrawn carriage industry has been shrinking for years. The city now has 10 carriage licenses that will expire at the end of the year, The Chicago Tribune reported . At one point, it had 60 licenses available, according to The Associated Press.

The indictment alleges Hutchinson and his company received referral commissions from insurance contracts obtained by the city. Hutchinsons resignation was announced Monday by City Administrator Doug Brimm. The announcement quoted part of a letter Hutchinson wrote to members of the Columbia City Council.

with continuing budget woes, overtime for police officers and firefighters is soaring.As reported by the SunTimes , taxpayers spent roughly 210 million on overtime last year.Thats an extraordinary amount of money. It raises the question do we have the right level of staffingLaurence Msall with Civic Federation said. Should we be hiring more people are our the abuses really where the focus should beThe surge in overtime comes as the city added more technology and manpower.Msall points to minimum staffing requirements for the fire department as part of the reason for the cost surge. He said the requirements are outdated.The Illinois General Assembly is complicate in the inefficiency because the state of Illinois often requires in the case of fireman how many firemen are on a truck, what the staffing levels are, Msall said. That does not reflect the actual needs, it reflects and outdated idea about how to staff fire prevention needs.The Firefighters Union notes the department provides crucial emergency medical services, but the citys inspector general has called for changes to the minimum staffing requirement.The mayor has said everything must be on the table.I think the mayor has shown her frustration on overtime, especially for police and for fire, but in particular, the city has not always done a great job of budgeting for overtime and being transparent about it, Msall said.The police department has been working on the overtime issue since Mayor Lightfoot demanded reforms over the summer. Since then, the department said it put in place structural changes to control overtime.Overtime is now monitored using electronic records. Personnel now swipe in and out of work and commanders are given an overtime budget to manage.On Thursday, the City Council Committee on Public Safety will meet. One alderman told WGN overtime is expected to be a topic of discussion.   \n",

Roderick Sawyer 6th, Raymond Lopez 15th, Stephanie Coleman 16th, David Moore 17th and Jeanette Taylor 20th are teaming up to hear residents concerns and share information and resources in an effort to jumpstart a longterm conversation about improving the South Side neighborhood.The communitywide town hall is set for 68 p.m. Tuesday at KennedyKing College, 6301 S. Halsted St.Taylor, elected to replace former Ald. Willie Cochran who is currently serving a year in federal prison for wire fraud, is one of the areas newest aldermen. She said Englewoods aldermen havent worked together in the past.For so long, the aldermen of Englewood have not worked together. That doesnt work for our city, or our constituents, she said. If we say were progressive, the progressive thing to do is to meet on, perhaps, a quarterly basis to make sure that all constituents are getting the services they need, and to hear different types of voices.Commissioner Maurice Cox from the Department of Planning and Development will also be on hand to talk about economic possibilities for the Southwest Side community. Cox went for ridealongs with all five aldermen last year, talking to each about what they wanted to see.One of the issues Taylor talked about during her campaign was the divided leadership in Englewood, and whether the community needed less aldermen.While all of the aldermen may not agree politically, Taylor told Block Club they all share a common goal: making sure the people of Englewood are heard.Taylor hopes that the town hall will allow residents to talk about public safety in a way that focuses less on bashing police and more on making sure the city does right by the community.This meeting is to reassure that people are at the table who actually come from Englewood who were born and bred there, who know the issues and are ready to do the work, Taylor said.Do stories like this matter to you Subscribe to Block Club Chicago .

Chicago mayor signs plan boosting sanctuary protections SOPHIA TAREEN Associated Press SaveCHICAGO  Mayor Lori Lightfoot signed a measure Tuesday strengthening Chicagos sanctuary policies by removing exceptions where local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.The revised ordinance, which easily cleared the City Council last month, follows years of campaigning by immigrant rights advocates whove said issues of immigration and the criminal justice system are separate.Previously, Chicagos Welcoming City ordinance allowed police to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in limited circumstances, including if a person living in the country without legal permission had an outstanding criminal warrant, a conviction or was named in the citys gang database.Chicago has been a welcoming city and a city of immigrants since its very founding, and proudly so, Lightfoot said.Opponents, including aldermen, cited concerns about crime and protecting gang members.But supporters said immigrants can now call authorities and cooperate with investigations without fear. Activists, who said previous sanctuary protections fell short, praised the move as a step toward addressing conflicts between police and communities throughout Chicago.No matter someones history, layering deportation on top of an already flawed and racist criminal justice system is a discriminatory and wrong, said a statement from a coalition called the Chicago Immigration Working Group.   \n",

                                                      Chicago authorizes traffic congestion tax on ride-hailing services A proposal to fight traffic congestion in Chicago by boosting taxes on certain ridehailing trips won city council approval on Tuesday as the city and ride providers alleged each other of penalizing lowincome passengers.Mayor Lori Lightfoots plan boosts the citys tax on singlepassenger trips and decreases the tax on shared rides while imposing new surcharges on weekday rides in the downtown area to raise 40 million for the fiscal year that starts January 1.Ridehailing companies Uber and Lyft have claimed the move would largely harm lowincome residents.Previously this month, Lightfoot, who is the citys first female AfricanAmerican mayor, had alleged Uber of trying to resist any type of regulation by stirring up racial tensions.Uber denied her claims and said alternative proposals it provided would spare lowerincome communities in Chicagos South and West sides from higher costs while raising more money for the budget of the city.Reuters analysis of data that ridesharing companies are must reveal to Chicago shows fares for shared rides in the city have increased enough over the past year, while fares for single riders have remained the same.The price increases for shared rides mainly affect Chicagos lowincome neighborhoods where most carpool rides are booked, the analysis revealed. Over this period of boosted fares, carpool ridership dropped.   \n",
