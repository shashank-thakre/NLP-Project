It tells our story and we must listen.\\nPeople share photos of Illinois' abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that we've just ignored and left behind. I've lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you don't share (or ask) for addresses.\\nOver the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. I'd like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, you'd think the owner would say, \"damn, there's a tree growing through my 442, I've got to move her.\" But that clearly didn't happen. And, why is it still there? It's not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photos?\\nAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .\\n\"The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.\\nPeople share photos of Illinois' abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that we've just ignored and left behind. I've lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you don't share (or ask) for addresses.\\nOver the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. I'd like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, you'd think the owner would say, \"damn, there's a tree growing through my 442, I've got to move her.\" But that clearly didn't happen. And, why is it still there? It's not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

       " 'Published: December 14, 2020 nanjanWere not exactly sure whats going here, but we have a pretty good idea. What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photos?\\nAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .\\n\"The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.\\nPeople share photos of Illinois' abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that we've just ignored and left behind. I've lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you don't share (or ask) for addresses.\\nOver the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. I'd like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, you'd think the owner would say, \"damn, there's a tree growing through my 442, I've got to move her.\" But that clearly didn't happen. And, why is it still there? It's not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File) Thursday, March 5, 2020 1:09 PM EST By The Associated Press, AP\\nNEW YORK (AP) — Wendell Goler, a longtime White House correspondent for Fox News Channel who reported on government since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, has died at age 70.\\nHe died this week of apparent kidney failure, said a former Fox colleague, Brit Hume.\\nGoler was a Fox News original, joining the network at its inception in 1996 and working his way up to senior White House foreign affairs correspondent. He retired in 2014. He worked for The Associated Press and Washington-area television stations before joining Fox.\\nHe was a panelist for Republican presidential debates in South Carolina and New Hampshire in 2007, and interviewed Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, and former First Lady Laura Bush.\\n“Wendell was a gifted correspondent, a wonderful colleague and a Fox News original whose reporting was respected on both sides of the aisle,\" said Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media. \"We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Marge and his entire family.”\\nGoler jokingly referred to himself as a “dinosaur” upon his retirement but said he was glad to work during a golden era in broadcasting.\\nHume called Goler a valued friend who “did consistently solid and balanced work and his reports were always well-crafted, clear and easy to follow.” AP    \n",

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

He retired in 2014. He worked for The Associated Press and Washingtonarea television stations before joining Fox.He was a panelist for Republican presidential debates in South Carolina and New Hampshire in 2007, and interviewed Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, and former First Lady Laura Bush.Wendell was a gifted correspondent, a wonderful colleague and a Fox News original whose reporting was respected on both sides of the aisle, said Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Marge and his entire family.Goler jokingly referred to himself as a dinosaur upon his retirement but said he was glad to work during a golden era in broadcasting.Hume called Goler a valued friend who did consistently solid and balanced work and his reports were always wellcrafted, clear and easy to follow.
