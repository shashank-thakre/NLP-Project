What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "      <td>Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Inspector General Michael Horowitz said he would examine whether the data subpoenaed by the Justice Department and turned over by Apple followed department policy and whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.Next Up In Washington NATO leaders declare China global security challenge Justices defer Harvard case on race in college admissions Biden, unlike predecessors, maintained Putin skepticism CPD officer used Nword, shared pictures when bragging about role in US Capitol riots: feds G7 pledge to share, but jostle for ground in the sandbox Congress, Justice Dept. probing Trump seizures of Dems data Most ReadMother of 3 killed in weekend mass shooting was in the prime of her life, cousin says Kimfier Miles, 29, was killed in a mass shooting early Saturday on the South Side that also wounded nine others.Horoscope for Monday, June 14, 2021Feuding stars of Windy City Rehab agree: We need help splitting up The pair have asked a Cook County judge to appoint a receiver to wind down their shared business interests, essentially a third party to oversee their financial divorce.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure.

       "3  Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.

And for someone who moved to Florida after growing up in the Midwest, our annual Christmas trip to Chicago has been the holiday balm to my heart that misses a good cold December and the festive magic Chicago at Christmas stirs up. My kids talk about our Chicago traditions all year longthe Macys window displays, the decorations, the way it feels straight out of a movie to be huddled in the little apartment where we stay while we watch from the big window as people walk by, on to holiday adventures. We were sad to miss our trip this year, but I wanted to recreate a little home version of some of our Chicago traditions. No, its not quite the same completing a puzzle by the fire in our living room than it is at the top of the Willis Tower like we usually do. But I knew I could whip up our own little magic at home to create the enchantment of the city this time of year, and I was delighted with the challenge. So Operation Christmas in Chicago at Home began. The kids didnt know anything about it which was half the fun. It started with a bucket list I had so much fun illustrating in my morning alone hours leading up to our celebration.I ordered Giordanos pizza to be shipped stay with me Lou Malnatis fansto each his own :o and Garrett popcorn, bought the kids Chicago sweatshirts to wrap up and ordered the annual Chicago Macys ornament which we always buy when we visit.Add twinkle lights, fake snow and a city skyline cut out of foam board and you have a party. Come join us in our Florida Chicagoland.Custom Pennant: Fellow Creatures Co on Etsy well be tucking this in our suitcase for our next actual Christmas trip to Chicago. Street Light Lamps: Hobby Lobby. Taxi with Packages: Target.I hung photos of all our old Chicago trips from the ceiling with fish line.and pulled out my vintage Chicago mugs my friends found these for me at a thrift shop for my first attempt at making the German gluhwein I always drink at the Christkindlmarket.We usually have a Christmas tea at the Drake with all sorts of delicious tea treats, so delicious tea treats it was.and whats a Chicago celebration without Chicago style hot dogs Lainey said shes never having a hot dog without celery salt again and stuffed pizza.There was snowand a picture from the stoop even though it wasnt a brownstone.We completed our holiday puzzle from a lower altitude.Played Christmas Bingo like we always do in my friends charming apartment where we stay.and we rode the holiday CTA to find a good cup of hot cocoa.We watched a Christmas movie while the kids made collages from photos of our favorite December memories in Chicago.We even made a snowman freeze cornstarch and add lotion to make faux snow.The night was very different from the Chicago celebrations we usually experience, but I know well remember this years trip forever and how having to stay home invited us to find new ways to celebrate being together.All of our kids have rolled with the changes this year with such grace. Their innocence and enthusiasm is so comforting.Well see you next year, Macys. We missed you.and to our Chicago friends we usually see this time of yearwe missed you more.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Uber drives up prices for shared rides, Chicago data reveals An Uber pickup location is pictured in San Diego, California, September 30. 2019. ReutersHow much ridehailing companies Uber and Lyft charge customers throughout a day is one of the most closely held secrets in Silicon Valley.But a law in Chicago requiring the companies to disclose fare data shines a light on how at least one of the former unicorns is trying to turn a profit for the first time.A Reuters analysis of the data shows fares for shared rides in the city have risen significantly over the past year, while fares for single riders have remained stable.The price increases for shared rides predominantly affect Chicagos lowincome neighborhoods, which is where most of the carpool rides are booked, the analysis showed. Over this period of increased fares, carpool ridership fell https:tmsnrt.rs33lLF5A.The Chicago data does not differentiate between rides operated by Uber Technologies Inc, Lyft Inc, or smaller rideshare rival Via. Data by Second Measure, which tracks credit card expenditures, estimates that Uber commands a roughly 72 market share in Chicago. The data also does not indicate whether similar strategies are being rolled out in other cities.The fare changes in Chicago show an attempt to reduce discounts for customers in order to help convince investors that ridehailing can be a profitable business model.But the shift comes with political risks, as cities from Chicago to London take ridehailing companies to task over congestion, driver treatment and passenger rights. On Monday, regulators in London stripped Ubers license for the second time in just over two years, pending an appeal, over a pattern of failures on safety and security.After reviewing the findings from the Chicago data, Uber said it has traditionally seen losses in its shared Pool rides segment. Earlier this month, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber was losing significant sums due to heavy discounts on those rides.We want Pool to be available to as many people and in as many cities as possible, and to do that it has to be financially sustainable for years to come through measures including pricing and better algorithms to find more pool riders, an Uber spokesman said.Lyft declined to comment on its pricing strategy, but said shared rides have increased access to affordable and reliable transportation, particularly in neighborhoods under served by public transit and passed over by taxis.Lyft said that given Uber controls nearly twothirds of the Chicago market, the data most closely reflected Ubers strategy, and noted its own data did not show a decrease in shared rides.Via, the smallest Chicago player almost exclusively focused on shared rides with an estimated 1 market share, also declined to comment on pricing but said its own interpretation of the Chicago data was consistent with the analysis.In city after city, we have seen that there is far more price sensitivity with pooled rides than with private, single passenger ones, Via said, adding that it was crucial for fees and taxes on shared rides to stay low in order to decrease congestion.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has proposed taxes on ridehailing services to combat congestion, by increasing the tax for solo trips and lowering taxes on shared rides. She also is pushing a new surcharge of 1.75 on weekday rides in the downtown area.Chicagos city council on Tuesday approved the congestion tax changes as part of the citys 2020 budget.Uber and Lyft, which have supported congestion taxes in New York and other cities, are fighting Lightfoots congestion proposal, calling it unfair for not including regular taxi services and disproportionately hurting lowerincome residents.They also said Lightfoots measure helps some of the citys richest parts in the north, dominated by white residents, while hurting predominantly black and Hispanic residents on the South and West Side.Lightfoot, Chicagos first female AfricanAmerican mayor, has rejected those claims, accusing Uber of stirring up racial tensions in opposition to the proposal.Uber and Lyft put forward an alternative taxation plan that was rejected by the city as doing too little to ease downtown congestion. Uber in a statement said it wished Chicago would remove fees on shared rides altogether.The Reuters analysis of more than one million Chicago rides between January and September 2019  the only full quarters for which the city currently makes data available  found that fares per mile increased 13 for shared rides. But they remained unchanged for private rides.Shared rides fell to about a third of all rides in a group of the least affluent neighborhoods of Chicago in the third quarter from about half of rides in the first.Presented with Reuters pricing analysis, city representatives said they interpreted the data as an attempt by the companies to change customer behavior.We have real concerns about the claims these companies make because actually theyre the ones causing the pain to the communities in terms of cost, not the mayors plan, said Rosa Escareno, Chicagos Commissioner of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection who led the congestion policy.Uber declined to directly comment on the citys allegations, but said it made no sense that passengers in a solo taxi ride downtown will pay no tax while those taking a shared trip far from downtown will.Lyft said the Mayor is attempting to distract from what her plan will do: backtrack on her campaign promises and raise the cost of transportation in Chicago for communities who can least afford it.

       "      <td>Walmart to offer free community job training in Chatham - Chicago Tribune By the end of the year, Walmart wants its West Chatham store to be a place shoppers can go to pick up skills for a new career along with their groceries.The Bentonville, Arkansasbased retailer recently broke ground on a Walmart Academy outside the South Side store. In addition to hosting training for employees, the 15,000squarefoot facility will have space for community members to train for jobs as medical assistants and HVAC technicians or take classes on financial literacy and job interview preparedness.Advertisement Walmarts Chatham store was heavily damaged during the civil unrest last summer that followed George Floyds death at the hands of Minneapolis police. It closed for more than five months, as did another hardhit Walmart in Austin.The idea of helping people get skills that can lead to jobs came out of conversations with community leaders about what we can do to add value to the community, said Keith Wyche, Walmarts vice president of community engagement and support.Advertisement More than 200 of the companys stores have Walmart Academies that train employees moving into management positions or other specialized roles, but they dont offer the range of community programs Walmart plans to have in Chatham.Superintendent Johnny Williamson arrives at the future site of the Walmart Academy in Chicagos Chatham neighborhood, June 29, 2021. Antonio Perez  Chicago Tribune Walmart announced plans for the Chatham Walmart Academy about a year ago, as it pledged to reopen its Chicago stores after repairing the damage.

       "      <td>Bicycle Tripping from the Windy City to the Big Apple – Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route Bicycle Tripping from the Windy City to the Big Apple  Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route By 0 Maps are now available for Adventure Cycling Associations Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route CNYC. The 1,160mile route from the Windy City to the Big Apple is covered in a fourmap set, plus two for the Philadelphia Alternate, allowing cyclists to tour the whole thing or ride a few preferred sections. Cartographer Nathan Taylor describes the route: Along the 1,160mile journey, youll pass through towering cities, forested mountains, Midwestern farm fields, historic railroad passages, and flat coastal lowlands punctuated by beach towns. Youll do so on smoothly paved lake or riverside bike paths, winding country highways and roads, crushed stone or gravel decommissioned railroad beds, expansive bridges or viaducts, wooden boardwalks, and, in one case, sharing a tunnel with an active railroad The maps feature turnbyturn directions, detailed navigational instructions, elevation profiles, and services cyclists will need along the route. Combined with Bicycle Route 66, the Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route gives cyclists a fourth option to cross the United States, this time from New York Citys Battery Park all the way to Santa Monica, taking in the three largest cities in the nation along its length. This new route, similar to Bicycle Route 66, is a departure from our traditional philosophy of mapping rural routes and avoiding large cities, said Carla Majernik, Adventure Cyclings Routes  Mapping Director. It links several major metropolitan areas of the Midwest and the Eastern Seaboard and uses many more miles of separate paths and rail trails than ever before on our routes. Youll still traverse rural America the bonus is enjoying the attractions only big cities have to offer. From Chicago to New York City, the new route passes through Indianapolis, Indiana, Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. If you take advantage of the Philadelphia Alternate , youll add only 13 miles overall and enjoy peaceful riding on the Great Allegheny Passage and the CO Canal. Cyclists will encounter numerous natural and manmade wonders along Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route, including: The International Circus Hall of Fame, The worlds largest basket, 911 Memorial, Statue of Liberty National Monument, The Wheeling Suspension Bridge, Hoosier Prairie State Nature Preserve, The Liberty Bell, Gettysburg National Military Park, Hickory Run State Park, Frank Lloyd Wrights Fallingwater, Hocking Hills State Park, Willis Tower Skydeck, and the Appalachian Plateau Region. The Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route map app is also available as a great accompaniment to the paper maps. Similar to the CNYC paper maps, this app has the information you need on the road. Some features of the app include: show or hide bicycling services e.g., campgrounds, bike shops, lodging, and towns, embedded Google search for even more services, contact services with handy clicktocall buttons, the ability to calculate the distance between two points on the route and see the elevation profile, the ability to switch between Google Maps and OpenCycleMap for more detail, and an offline capability when there is no available cell service. Outofstate cyclists can access the CNYC at any of the major cities along the route where they can find an international airport, and the route closely parallels Amtrak lines in several states. The Capitol Limited, Piedmont, and Vermonter routes all offer carryon bike service . When planning their tour, cyclists should time their itinerary between early April and late August. The route hovers due north of the MasonDixon Line and the 45th parallel, so November through March would likely be cold and snowy in parts. Autumn can be another good time for a trip, with its cooler nighttime air temperatures and lower humidity. For an autumn excursion, cyclists should shoot for early September to midOctober.

       "      <td>Amazon will consider opening up to 3,000 cashierless stores by 2021 after opening its first Chicago location this week Amazon.com is considering a plan to open as many as 3,000 new Amazon Go cashierless stores in the next few years, according to people familiar with matter, an aggressive and costly expansion that would threaten convenience chains like 7Eleven , quickservice sandwich shops like Subway and Panera Bread, and momandpop pizzerias and taco trucks.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos sees eliminating mealtime logjams in busy cities as the best way for Amazon to reinvent the bricksandmortar shopping experience, where most spending still occurs. But hes still experimenting with the best format: a convenience store that sells fresh prepared foods as well as a limited grocery selection similar to 7Eleven franchises, or a place to simply pick up a quick bite to eat for people in a rush, similar to the U.K.based chain Pret a Manger, one of the people said.An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. The company unveiled its first cashierless store near its headquarters in Seattle in 2016 and has since announced two additional sites in Seattle. The first store outside Amazons hometown opened Monday in Chicago . Two of the new stores offer only a limited selection of salads, sandwiches and snacks, showing that Amazon is experimenting with the concept simply as a mealontherun option. Two other stores, including the original Amazon Go, also have a small selection of groceries, making it more akin to a convenience store.Shoppers use a smartphone app to enter the store. Once they scan their phones at a turnstile, they can grab what they want from a range of salads, sandwiches, drinks and snacks  and then walk out without stopping at a cash register. Sensors and computervision technology detect what shoppers take and bills them automatically, eliminating checkout lines.The challenge to Amazons plan is the high cost of opening each location. The original Amazon Go in downtown Seattle required more than 1 million in hardware alone, according to a person familiar with the matter. Narrowing the focus to prepared foodtogo would reduce the upfront cost of opening each store because it would require fewer cameras and sensors. Prepared foods also have wider profit margins than groceries, which would help decrease the time it takes for the stores to become profitable.Amazon has become the worlds largest online retailer by offering a vast selection and quick, convenient delivery. In physical stores, Amazon is emphasizing convenience over selection to win business. Amazons other bricksandmortar initiatives include about 20 bookstores around the U.S., including one on Southport Avenue in Chicagos Lakeview neighborhood, and the natural grocery chain Whole Foods Market, acquired last year. Amazon Go is the most distinctive of all of its physical stores.At a Washington, D.C., event last week, Bezos said Amazon was very interested in physical stores, but only if it has something new to offer. If we offer a metoo product, its not going to work, he said.Such an expansion could put Amazon back into an investment cycle. Bezos is willing to lose money on longterm initiatives when he smells opportunity. Amazon Web Services, the companys fastgrowing and profitable cloudcomputing business, was unprofitable for years and Bezos stuck with it, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon also routinely loses money expanding internationally.Adding 3,000 convenience stores would make Amazon Go among the biggest chains in U.S. The internet giant is considering plans to have about 10 locations open by the end of this year, about 50 locations in major metro areas in 2019, and then as many as 3,000 by 2021, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing internal plans. Opening multiple locations in proximity, like its doing in Seattle, could also help Amazon reduce costs by centralizing food production in one kitchen serving many stores.The Tribune previously reported that Amazon was planning stores in Willis Tower and an office building connected to the Ogilvie Transportation Center. The company has declined to comment.The U.S. currently has 155,000 convenience stores, with 122,500 of them combined with gas stations, according to industry group NACS. Nonfuel purchases at convenience stores totaled 233 billion in 2016, with cigarettes and other tobacco products the bestselling items.Amazon is targeting dense urban areas with lots of young, busy, affluent residents willing to spend a little more than a typical fastfood experience for better quality food, the people said. The target locations make it less of a threat to suburban gas stationconvenience store combinations and more of a threat to big cities quickservice eateries, such as Subway Restaurants, Panera Bread Co. and Pret a Manger. U.K.based Pret has 450 locations worldwide, including New York, Boston and Chicago, focusing on fresh, healthy grabandgo foods.Amazon Go will be more of a threat to fastcasual restaurants if it is targeting cities, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of NACS. Shoppers rate location and a lack of lines as the most important factors when shopping for convenience, he said.Amazon Go already has no lines, Lenard said. The key to success will be convenient locations. If its a quarter mile from where people are walking and biking, the novelty of the technology wont matter. Its too far away.Chicago Tribune staff contributed.Just walk out shopping: Amazon Go opens first Chicago location of its cashierless convenience store Fish, fabric and furniture: Trumps latest tariffs will hit consumers after the holidays, Chicagoarea companies warn AbbVie paid doctors to overprescribe Humira, California alleges in lawsuit Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Amazon.com Jeff Bezos 7Eleven</td>\n",

And for someone who moved to Florida after growing up in the Midwest, our annual Christmas trip to Chicago has been the holiday balm to my heart that misses a good cold December and the festive magic Chicago at Christmas stirs up. My kids talk about our Chicago traditions all year longthe Macys window displays, the decorations, the way it feels straight out of a movie to be huddled in the little apartment where we stay while we watch from the big window as people walk by, on to holiday adventures. We were sad to miss our trip this year, but I wanted to recreate a little home version of some of our Chicago traditions. No, its not quite the same completing a puzzle by the fire in our living room than it is at the top of the Willis Tower like we usually do. But I knew I could whip up our own little magic at home to create the enchantment of the city this time of year, and I was delighted with the challenge. So Operation Christmas in Chicago at Home began. The kids didnt know anything about it which was half the fun. It started with a bucket list I had so much fun illustrating in my morning alone hours leading up to our celebration.I ordered Giordanos pizza to be shipped stay with me Lou Malnatis fansto each his own :o and Garrett popcorn, bought the kids Chicago sweatshirts to wrap up and ordered the annual Chicago Macys ornament which we always buy when we visit.Add twinkle lights, fake snow and a city skyline cut out of foam board and you have a party. Come join us in our Florida Chicagoland.Custom Pennant: Fellow Creatures Co on Etsy well be tucking this in our suitcase for our next actual Christmas trip to Chicago. Street Light Lamps: Hobby Lobby. Taxi with Packages: Target.I hung photos of all our old Chicago trips from the ceiling with fish line.and pulled out my vintage Chicago mugs my friends found these for me at a thrift shop for my first attempt at making the German gluhwein I always drink at the Christkindlmarket.We usually have a Christmas tea at the Drake with all sorts of delicious tea treats, so delicious tea treats it was.and whats a Chicago celebration without Chicago style hot dogs Lainey said shes never having a hot dog without celery salt again and stuffed pizza.There was snowand a picture from the stoop even though it wasnt a brownstone.We completed our holiday puzzle from a lower altitude.Played Christmas Bingo like we always do in my friends charming apartment where we stay.and we rode the holiday CTA to find a good cup of hot cocoa.We watched a Christmas movie while the kids made collages from photos of our favorite December memories in Chicago.We even made a snowman freeze cornstarch and add lotion to make faux snow.The night was very different from the Chicago celebrations we usually experience, but I know well remember this years trip forever and how having to stay home invited us to find new ways to celebrate being together.All of our kids have rolled with the changes this year with such grace. Their innocence and enthusiasm is so comforting.Well see you next year, Macys. We missed you.and to our Chicago friends we usually see this time of yearwe missed you more.   \n",

ReutersHow much ridehailing companies Uber and Lyft charge customers throughout a day is one of the most closely held secrets in Silicon Valley.But a law in Chicago requiring the companies to disclose fare data shines a light on how at least one of the former unicorns is trying to turn a profit for the first time.A Reuters analysis of the data shows fares for shared rides in the city have risen significantly over the past year, while fares for single riders have remained stable.The price increases for shared rides predominantly affect Chicagos lowincome neighborhoods, which is where most of the carpool rides are booked, the analysis showed. Over this period of increased fares, carpool ridership fell https:tmsnrt.rs33lLF5A.The Chicago data does not differentiate between rides operated by Uber Technologies Inc, Lyft Inc, or smaller rideshare rival Via. Data by Second Measure, which tracks credit card expenditures, estimates that Uber commands a roughly 72 market share in Chicago. The data also does not indicate whether similar strategies are being rolled out in other cities.The fare changes in Chicago show an attempt to reduce discounts for customers in order to help convince investors that ridehailing can be a profitable business model.But the shift comes with political risks, as cities from Chicago to London take ridehailing companies to task over congestion, driver treatment and passenger rights. On Monday, regulators in London stripped Ubers license for the second time in just over two years, pending an appeal, over a pattern of failures on safety and security.After reviewing the findings from the Chicago data, Uber said it has traditionally seen losses in its shared Pool rides segment. Earlier this month, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said Uber was losing significant sums due to heavy discounts on those rides.We want Pool to be available to as many people and in as many cities as possible, and to do that it has to be financially sustainable for years to come through measures including pricing and better algorithms to find more pool riders, an Uber spokesman said.Lyft declined to comment on its pricing strategy, but said shared rides have increased access to affordable and reliable transportation, particularly in neighborhoods under served by public transit and passed over by taxis.Lyft said that given Uber controls nearly twothirds of the Chicago market, the data most closely reflected Ubers strategy, and noted its own data did not show a decrease in shared rides.Via, the smallest Chicago player almost exclusively focused on shared rides with an estimated 1 market share, also declined to comment on pricing but said its own interpretation of the Chicago data was consistent with the analysis.In city after city, we have seen that there is far more price sensitivity with pooled rides than with private, single passenger ones, Via said, adding that it was crucial for fees and taxes on shared rides to stay low in order to decrease congestion.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has proposed taxes on ridehailing services to combat congestion, by increasing the tax for solo trips and lowering taxes on shared rides. She also is pushing a new surcharge of 1.75 on weekday rides in the downtown area.Chicagos city council on Tuesday approved the congestion tax changes as part of the citys 2020 budget.Uber and Lyft, which have supported congestion taxes in New York and other cities, are fighting Lightfoots congestion proposal, calling it unfair for not including regular taxi services and disproportionately hurting lowerincome residents.They also said Lightfoots measure helps some of the citys richest parts in the north, dominated by white residents, while hurting predominantly black and Hispanic residents on the South and West Side.Lightfoot, Chicagos first female AfricanAmerican mayor, has rejected those claims, accusing Uber of stirring up racial tensions in opposition to the proposal.Uber and Lyft put forward an alternative taxation plan that was rejected by the city as doing too little to ease downtown congestion. Uber in a statement said it wished Chicago would remove fees on shared rides altogether.The Reuters analysis of more than one million Chicago rides between January and September 2019  the only full quarters for which the city currently makes data available  found that fares per mile increased 13 for shared rides. But they remained unchanged for private rides.Shared rides fell to about a third of all rides in a group of the least affluent neighborhoods of Chicago in the third quarter from about half of rides in the first.Presented with Reuters pricing analysis, city representatives said they interpreted the data as an attempt by the companies to change customer behavior.We have real concerns about the claims these companies make because actually theyre the ones causing the pain to the communities in terms of cost, not the mayors plan, said Rosa Escareno, Chicagos Commissioner of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection who led the congestion policy.Uber declined to directly comment on the citys allegations, but said it made no sense that passengers in a solo taxi ride downtown will pay no tax while those taking a shared trip far from downtown will.Lyft said the Mayor is attempting to distract from what her plan will do: backtrack on her campaign promises and raise the cost of transportation in Chicago for communities who can least afford it.

In addition to hosting training for employees, the 15,000squarefoot facility will have space for community members to train for jobs as medical assistants and HVAC technicians or take classes on financial literacy and job interview preparedness.Advertisement Walmarts Chatham store was heavily damaged during the civil unrest last summer that followed George Floyds death at the hands of Minneapolis police. It closed for more than five months, as did another hardhit Walmart in Austin.The idea of helping people get skills that can lead to jobs came out of conversations with community leaders about what we can do to add value to the community, said Keith Wyche, Walmarts vice president of community engagement and support.Advertisement More than 200 of the companys stores have Walmart Academies that train employees moving into management positions or other specialized roles, but they dont offer the range of community programs Walmart plans to have in Chatham.Superintendent Johnny Williamson arrives at the future site of the Walmart Academy in Chicagos Chatham neighborhood, June 29, 2021.

The 1,160mile route from the Windy City to the Big Apple is covered in a fourmap set, plus two for the Philadelphia Alternate, allowing cyclists to tour the whole thing or ride a few preferred sections. Cartographer Nathan Taylor describes the route: Along the 1,160mile journey, youll pass through towering cities, forested mountains, Midwestern farm fields, historic railroad passages, and flat coastal lowlands punctuated by beach towns. Youll do so on smoothly paved lake or riverside bike paths, winding country highways and roads, crushed stone or gravel decommissioned railroad beds, expansive bridges or viaducts, wooden boardwalks, and, in one case, sharing a tunnel with an active railroad The maps feature turnbyturn directions, detailed navigational instructions, elevation profiles, and services cyclists will need along the route. Combined with Bicycle Route 66, the Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route gives cyclists a fourth option to cross the United States, this time from New York Citys Battery Park all the way to Santa Monica, taking in the three largest cities in the nation along its length. This new route, similar to Bicycle Route 66, is a departure from our traditional philosophy of mapping rural routes and avoiding large cities, said Carla Majernik, Adventure Cyclings Routes  Mapping Director. It links several major metropolitan areas of the Midwest and the Eastern Seaboard and uses many more miles of separate paths and rail trails than ever before on our routes. Youll still traverse rural America the bonus is enjoying the attractions only big cities have to offer. From Chicago to New York City, the new route passes through Indianapolis, Indiana, Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. If you take advantage of the Philadelphia Alternate , youll add only 13 miles overall and enjoy peaceful riding on the Great Allegheny Passage and the CO Canal. Cyclists will encounter numerous natural and manmade wonders along Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route, including: The International Circus Hall of Fame, The worlds largest basket, 911 Memorial, Statue of Liberty National Monument, The Wheeling Suspension Bridge, Hoosier Prairie State Nature Preserve, The Liberty Bell, Gettysburg National Military Park, Hickory Run State Park, Frank Lloyd Wrights Fallingwater, Hocking Hills State Park, Willis Tower Skydeck, and the Appalachian Plateau Region. The Chicago to New York City Bicycle Route map app is also available as a great accompaniment to the paper maps. Similar to the CNYC paper maps, this app has the information you need on the road. Some features of the app include: show or hide bicycling services e.g., campgrounds, bike shops, lodging, and towns, embedded Google search for even more services, contact services with handy clicktocall buttons, the ability to calculate the distance between two points on the route and see the elevation profile, the ability to switch between Google Maps and OpenCycleMap for more detail, and an offline capability when there is no available cell service. Outofstate cyclists can access the CNYC at any of the major cities along the route where they can find an international airport, and the route closely parallels Amtrak lines in several states. The Capitol Limited, Piedmont, and Vermonter routes all offer carryon bike service . When planning their tour, cyclists should time their itinerary between early April and late August. The route hovers due north of the MasonDixon Line and the 45th parallel, so November through March would likely be cold and snowy in parts. Autumn can be another good time for a trip, with its cooler nighttime air temperatures and lower humidity. For an autumn excursion, cyclists should shoot for early September to midOctober.

       "1286  Amazon will consider opening up to 3,000 cashierless stores by 2021 after opening its first Chicago location this week Amazon.com is considering a plan to open as many as 3,000 new Amazon Go cashierless stores in the next few years, according to people familiar with matter, an aggressive and costly expansion that would threaten convenience chains like 7Eleven , quickservice sandwich shops like Subway and Panera Bread, and momandpop pizzerias and taco trucks.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos sees eliminating mealtime logjams in busy cities as the best way for Amazon to reinvent the bricksandmortar shopping experience, where most spending still occurs. But hes still experimenting with the best format: a convenience store that sells fresh prepared foods as well as a limited grocery selection similar to 7Eleven franchises, or a place to simply pick up a quick bite to eat for people in a rush, similar to the U.K.based chain Pret a Manger, one of the people said.An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. The company unveiled its first cashierless store near its headquarters in Seattle in 2016 and has since announced two additional sites in Seattle. The first store outside Amazons hometown opened Monday in Chicago . Two of the new stores offer only a limited selection of salads, sandwiches and snacks, showing that Amazon is experimenting with the concept simply as a mealontherun option. Two other stores, including the original Amazon Go, also have a small selection of groceries, making it more akin to a convenience store.Shoppers use a smartphone app to enter the store. Once they scan their phones at a turnstile, they can grab what they want from a range of salads, sandwiches, drinks and snacks  and then walk out without stopping at a cash register. Sensors and computervision technology detect what shoppers take and bills them automatically, eliminating checkout lines.The challenge to Amazons plan is the high cost of opening each location. The original Amazon Go in downtown Seattle required more than 1 million in hardware alone, according to a person familiar with the matter. Narrowing the focus to prepared foodtogo would reduce the upfront cost of opening each store because it would require fewer cameras and sensors. Prepared foods also have wider profit margins than groceries, which would help decrease the time it takes for the stores to become profitable.Amazon has become the worlds largest online retailer by offering a vast selection and quick, convenient delivery. In physical stores, Amazon is emphasizing convenience over selection to win business. Amazons other bricksandmortar initiatives include about 20 bookstores around the U.S., including one on Southport Avenue in Chicagos Lakeview neighborhood, and the natural grocery chain Whole Foods Market, acquired last year. Amazon Go is the most distinctive of all of its physical stores.At a Washington, D.C., event last week, Bezos said Amazon was very interested in physical stores, but only if it has something new to offer. If we offer a metoo product, its not going to work, he said.Such an expansion could put Amazon back into an investment cycle. Bezos is willing to lose money on longterm initiatives when he smells opportunity. Amazon Web Services, the companys fastgrowing and profitable cloudcomputing business, was unprofitable for years and Bezos stuck with it, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon also routinely loses money expanding internationally.Adding 3,000 convenience stores would make Amazon Go among the biggest chains in U.S. The internet giant is considering plans to have about 10 locations open by the end of this year, about 50 locations in major metro areas in 2019, and then as many as 3,000 by 2021, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing internal plans. Opening multiple locations in proximity, like its doing in Seattle, could also help Amazon reduce costs by centralizing food production in one kitchen serving many stores.The Tribune previously reported that Amazon was planning stores in Willis Tower and an office building connected to the Ogilvie Transportation Center. The company has declined to comment.The U.S. currently has 155,000 convenience stores, with 122,500 of them combined with gas stations, according to industry group NACS. Nonfuel purchases at convenience stores totaled 233 billion in 2016, with cigarettes and other tobacco products the bestselling items.Amazon is targeting dense urban areas with lots of young, busy, affluent residents willing to spend a little more than a typical fastfood experience for better quality food, the people said. The target locations make it less of a threat to suburban gas stationconvenience store combinations and more of a threat to big cities quickservice eateries, such as Subway Restaurants, Panera Bread Co. and Pret a Manger. U.K.based Pret has 450 locations worldwide, including New York, Boston and Chicago, focusing on fresh, healthy grabandgo foods.Amazon Go will be more of a threat to fastcasual restaurants if it is targeting cities, said Jeff Lenard, vice president of NACS. Shoppers rate location and a lack of lines as the most important factors when shopping for convenience, he said.Amazon Go already has no lines, Lenard said. The key to success will be convenient locations. If its a quarter mile from where people are walking and biking, the novelty of the technology wont matter. Its too far away.Chicago Tribune staff contributed.Just walk out shopping: Amazon Go opens first Chicago location of its cashierless convenience store Fish, fabric and furniture: Trumps latest tariffs will hit consumers after the holidays, Chicagoarea companies warn AbbVie paid doctors to overprescribe Humira, California alleges in lawsuit Privacy Policy Copyright  2018, Chicago Tribune Amazon.com Jeff Bezos 7Eleven   \n",

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

       "      <td>Nazareth Home in East Chicago closing after 27 years of service to children The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ founded Nazareth Home in 1993 to take care of abused and abandoned children with unique medical needs. It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "      <td>Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Inspector General Michael Horowitz said he would examine whether the data subpoenaed by the Justice Department and turned over by Apple followed department policy and whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.Next Up In Washington NATO leaders declare China global security challenge Justices defer Harvard case on race in college admissions Biden, unlike predecessors, maintained Putin skepticism CPD officer used Nword, shared pictures when bragging about role in US Capitol riots: feds G7 pledge to share, but jostle for ground in the sandbox Congress, Justice Dept. probing Trump seizures of Dems data Most ReadMother of 3 killed in weekend mass shooting was in the prime of her life, cousin says Kimfier Miles, 29, was killed in a mass shooting early Saturday on the South Side that also wounded nine others.Horoscope for Monday, June 14, 2021Feuding stars of Windy City Rehab agree: We need help splitting up The pair have asked a Cook County judge to appoint a receiver to wind down their shared business interests, essentially a third party to oversee their financial divorce.

What do you think the story is with these photosAbout a month ago, I joined a public Facebook group called, ILLINOIS Abandoned Images .The beauty in the old, simplicity, the forgotten, is something to be cherished and never forgotten. It tells our story and we must listen.People share photos of Illinois abandoned houses, farms, commercial buildings, and just about anything else that weve just ignored and left behind. Ive lost quite a bit of time looking at some pretty remarkable photos. The only rule for being a part of this group, besides acting like a respectable adult, appears to be that you dont share or ask for addresses.Over the weekend, one member shared a couple photos of this Oldsmobile 442 that was just left behind. The stories that muscle car could tell... if cars could talk. Id like to know the story of how a tree just grew right through it. At some point, youd think the owner would say, damn, theres a tree growing through my 442, Ive got to move her. But that clearly didnt happen. And, why is it still there Its not like that tree just grew that big overnight.

It served hundreds of children from newborn to age 6 who were referred there by the Indiana Department of Child Services.Nazareth Home provided medical, spiritual, and emotional care in a home setting in a quiet residential neighborhood in East Chicago, fostering childrens early development.Two years ago, Nazareth Home received a license to be a group home, but the federal Family First Act became law shortly after, drastically reducing the number of foster kids placed in group homes. The population at Nazareth Home dwindled to the point that in midJuly there were no resident children, and The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ made the decision to disband the home.The Nazareth Home employed medical care providers and child care professionals, relying also on a group of volunteers to cuddle with the abandoned children.We are grateful for all the time you have volunteered at the Nazareth Home, Ancilla Systems Executive Director Sister Mary Ellen Goeller wrote in a letter to volunteers informing them of the closure. You gave of your time to provide love to so many of the children.

       "3  Justice official resigning amid uproar over Dems’ subpoenas - Chicago Sun-Times WASHINGTON  The Justice Departments top national security official is resigning from his position after revelations that the department under President Donald Trump secretly seized records from Democrats and members of the media.John Demers, a Trump appointee, will leave by the end of next week, a Justice Department official told The Associated Press on Monday. Demers, who was sworn in a few weeks after the subpoena for the Democrats records, is one of the few Trump appointees who has remained in the Biden administration. He had planned for weeks to leave the department by the end of June, a second person familiar with the matter said.The official and the person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.Demers resignation comes amid questions about what he knew about the Justice Departments efforts to secretly seize the phone data from House Democrats and reporters as part of the aggressive investigations into leaks.Attorney General Merrick Garland emphasized in a statement Monday that political or other improper considerations must play no role in any investigative or prosecutorial decisions and noted the departments inspector general has already launched an investigation.Consistent with our commitment to the rule of law, he said, we must ensure that full weight is accorded to separationofpowers concerns moving forward.News emerged last week that the Justice Department had secretly subpoenaed Apple for metadata from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep. Eric Swalwell, in 2018, as their committee was investigating Trumps ties to Russia. Schiff at the time was the top Democrat on the panel, which was led by Republicans.The records of at least 12 people connected to the House intelligence panel were eventually shared with the Justice Department by Apple after the subpoena was issued in 2018. The people included aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor.The subpoena, issued Feb. 6, 2018, requested information on 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, Apple said. It also included a nondisclosure order that prohibited the company from notifying any of the people and was renewed three times, the company said in a statement.Demers has been in charge of the departments national security division since late February 2018, and his division has played a role in each of the leak investigations.He will be temporarily replaced by Mark Lesko, the acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, the official said, until President Joe Bidens official pick, Matthew Olsen, is approved by the Senate.Olsen is an Uber executive with experience in the Justice Department. He has served as director of the National Counterterrorism Center and as general counsel for the National Security Agency. Demers had remained in place while Olsen awaits a confirmation hearing. Lesko will fill the role until Olsen is confirmed.The Justice Departments inspector general has launched a probe into the matter after a request from Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.
